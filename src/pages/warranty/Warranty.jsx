          “Device”) will be free from defects in manufacture and workmanship for
          a period of one (1) year from the date of purchase when used under
          normal conditions and maintained according to the requirements
          outlined in the Instruction Manual provided with the Device. This
          Limited Warranty is subject to the conditions and exclusions in
          Section II below. This Limited Warranty applies only to the original
          buyer of the Device in the United States or Canada. For warranty
          coverage, a Return Authorization number, obtained by submitting a
          warranty registration card as described in Section III below and Proof
          of Purchase as the original purchaser, is required. Buyers are
          responsible for the return shipping cost of any defective Device,
          which must be shipped prepaid and insured (COD’s are not accepted),
          provided that, Moon in its discretion, may refund the return shipping
          costs. A buyer’s sole remedy for any Device with a defect in
          manufacture or workmanship shall be repair, exchange, or replacement
          of the Device, at Moon’s discretion. If the Device is replaced, Moon
          reserves the right to do so with a Device of equal or greater value.
          The cost of reshipping a repaired, exchanged or replacement Device
          from Moon to a Buyer under this warranty will be paid by Moon.

        <p className="warranty-content">
          If a replacement Device is issued by Moon, the coverage under this
          Limited Warranty shall continue for six months following buyer’s
          receipt date of the replacement Device, or the remainder of the
          original warranty period, whichever is greater.
