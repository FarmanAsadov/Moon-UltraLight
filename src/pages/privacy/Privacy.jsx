          Your privacy is critically important to us. At Moon Selfie, Inc.
          (“Moon”) we have a few fundamental principles:
        </h3>
        <ul className="privacy-list">
          <li className="privacy-list-item">
            We only ask for personal information we truly need .
          </li>
          <li className="privacy-list-item">
            We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to
            comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.
          </li>
          <li className="privacy-list-item">
            We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required
            for the on-going operation of one of our services.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3 className="privact-caption">Website Visitors</h3>
        <p className="privacy-content">
          Like most website operators, Moon collects non-personally-identifying
          information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make
          available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring
          site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Moon’s purpose in
          collecting non-personally identifying information is to better
          understand how Moon visitors use its website. From time to time, Moon
          may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate,
          e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
          Moon also collects potentially personally-identifying information like
          Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users. IP addresses are
          used to help diagnose problems with our servers and to administer our
          website. Moon only discloses IP addresses under the same circumstances
          that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as
          described below.

        <h3 className="privacy-caption">
          Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information
        </h3>
        <p className="privacy-content">
          Certain visitors to Moon’s websites choose to interact with Moon in
          ways that require Moon to gather personally-identifying information.
          The amount and type of information that Moon gathers depends on the
          nature of the interaction. In each case, Moon collects such
          information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the
          purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Moon. Moon does not disclose
          personally-identifying information other than as described below. And
          visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying
          information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in
          certain website-related activities.

          response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or
          when Moon believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably

          personally-identifying information, including the use of SSL

          certain information about the disclosure of that information to third

        <p className="privacy-content">
          If you are a resident of or are located in the European Economic Area
          (“EEA”), you may also have certain rights under the General Data
          Protection Regulation (“GDPR”). Personal data you provide on any of
          Moon’s websites is only collected with your consent, and may be
          transmitted outside of the EEA to Moon (or computer servers maintained
          for the benefit of Moon) pursuant to that consent. In general, under
          the GDPR you may:

          practicable, although your right to have your personal data deleted is

          If you consider that our processing of your personal information
          infringes data protection laws, you have a legal right to lodge a

          this may happen if your personal data is transferred to Moon servers
          located in a country outside of the EEA. These countries may not have
          similar data protection laws to the EEA. By submitting your personal
          data, you’re agreeing to this transfer, storing or processing. If Moon
          transfers your information outside of the EEA in this way, it will
          take steps so appropriate security measures are taken with the aim of
          ensuring that your privacy rights continue to be protected as outlined
